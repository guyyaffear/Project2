# Project2
We are creating an app for the ease of users to determine where they would prefer to spend their time based on environmental factors â€“ we are doing this through moment npm to capture real time information regarding date and time, weather api for current weather, Map api for transportation updates and use the server to request and post information from the user as well as collect information for events that are currently happening or planned.
We want to provide all the information for the use about
Subway transportation
Current weather
Current date and time
The current state of busyness based on population
What events are happening in the area
